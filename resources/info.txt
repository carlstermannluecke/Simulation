evaluation
	Some plots that were created for the evaluation of the gradient following behavior.

gradient_maps 
	MATLAB scripts to generate gradient and height maps, as well as a folder with some examples.
	
logs
	Here all the Finken logs are saved when the simulation is stopped.
	
noise_estimation
	MATLAB scripts with which real IMU data can be analyzed to estimate a realistic value for the noise magnitude.
	
presentation
	The presentation slides and demo videos.
	
reference 
	the landscape scene and the associated script from the ss15 branch so we can look at how the color sensor was implemented.
