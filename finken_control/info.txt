ExternalApiCall contains the python script to control the vrep simulation.
	Also contains a script to load, parse and plot log files created by the Finken.

legacy contains old scene and script files, that were created as we were working on the different parts of the project.
	The script in ExternalApiCall was programmed for the LocalMapGradient scene in this folder.
	It probably also works with the SwarmGradient file if there is only one Finken, but not for multiple Finken.
	
SwarmGradient.ttt is the main scene file and finkenSwarmGradient.lua the main script file that defines the Finken behavior.
