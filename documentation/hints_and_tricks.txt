to open the scripts: menu tools>scripts
or click page/script icon next to associated object in scene hierarchy


change texture of an object: double-click lowest object in scene hierarchy
	in scene object properties: Adjust texture --> load new texture --> adjust u/v scaling (5, 5 for landscape.ttt scene)
	
to get VREP to find the script file in Windows:
	Option 1: move file into lua folder in vrep installation folder
	Option 2: create environment variable LUA_PATH and add path to script file. LUA_PATH should be: LUA_PATH;C:\Path\to\new\folder\?.lua;C:\another\path\to\a\folder\?.lua
	Option 3: create hard link with administrator command line: mklink /H C:\Path\to\vrep\installation\folder\lua\scriptname.lua C:\Path\to\actual\script\location\scriptname.lua
	
	Option 2 probably best.
	Option 1 is annoying.
	Option 3 breaks when switching branches.
	
Using the finkenMaster.ttt scene in vrep/scenes from the master branch should work as intended, as long as vrep/lua can find the script files. Behavior should be changed in the finken.lua file in the customX functions.
	Probably best, to copy finkenMaster and then modify that scene as needed.
	
When creating a vision sensor:
	right click in 3d view --> add --> floating view
	then select vision sensor, right click in floating window --> view --> associate view with selected vision sensor
